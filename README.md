# Visualizing-Quantum-Computing-using-fractals

**Intro / about the project**
- Link to blog 
  
<br />

**Getting started**
 - upload the notebooks to quantum-computing.ibm.com/
 - Start with a default 1- and 2-qubit circuit yielding nice fractals
    - Explain why you need to add a rotationÂ 
 - Link to the IBM Quantum Composer, tutorial
 - You can also choose to write the qiskit code and not use the Composer
