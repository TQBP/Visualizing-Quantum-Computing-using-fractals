# Visualizing Quantum Computing using fractals

**Introduction**
<br />
Quantum computing can be pretty abstract. As a result, it's rather challenging to get the imagination going when dealing with qubits, quantum circuits and quantum states. As people get started using quantum computing, one of the biggest challenges is visualizing the complex mathematics underlying quantum states. Typically, we rely on the [Bloch sphere](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-states/representing-qubit-states.html#bloch-sphere) and [Q-sphere](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/docs/iqx/visualizations#q-sphere-view). However, given the richness of the field of complex numbers, there are plenty of more interesting ways to represent quantum information.
<br />

I created two notebooks to show how quantum computing can be visualized using fractals. <br />
The 1-qubit notebook demonstrates this with one qubit in the ideal case, mimicking running on a fault-tolerant quantum computer with a simulator. Try it yourself, either go with the default quantum circuit or create your own 1-qubit quantum circuit and also see how the fractal looks after running on a real quantum computer!
The 2-qubit notebook makes it possible to create fractals that can be used to visualize two-qubit quantum circuits, showing how, e.g., quantum entanglement may look like a fractal. Of course, you may also use a real quantum computer to generate the fractal and compare with the simulated.

**Getting started**
 - upload the notebooks to quantum-computing.ibm.com/
 - Start with a default 1- and 2-qubit circuit yielding nice fractals
    - Explain why you need to add a rotationÂ 
 - Link to the IBM Quantum Composer, tutorial
 - You can also choose to write the qiskit code and not use the Composer
