# Visualizing Quantum Computing using fractals

**Introduction**
<br />
Quantum computing can be pretty abstract. As a result, it's rather challenging to get the imagination going when dealing with qubits, quantum circuits and quantum states. As people get started using quantum computing, one of the biggest challenges is visualizing the complex mathematics underlying quantum states. Typically, we rely on the [Bloch sphere](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-states/representing-qubit-states.html#bloch-sphere) and [Q-sphere](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/docs/iqx/visualizations#q-sphere-view). However, given the richness of the field of complex numbers, there are plenty of more interesting ways to represent quantum information.

**Getting started**
 - upload the notebooks to quantum-computing.ibm.com/
 - Start with a default 1- and 2-qubit circuit yielding nice fractals
    - Explain why you need to add a rotationÂ 
 - Link to the IBM Quantum Composer, tutorial
 - You can also choose to write the qiskit code and not use the Composer
